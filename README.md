# Summer2025
Hi! I'm Dorofei Maxim, a 14-year-old self-taught developer from the Republic of Moldova. I started coding at age 9 with Scratch and have evolved through Python, LuaU, and now React development.

Everything I create is 100% solo work - no team, no external help, just pure passion and dedication to programming.
